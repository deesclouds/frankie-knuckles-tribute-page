## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

## Optimizations
I continue to learn more about Frankie Knuckles and update this page with any facts and additional information that I learn about this awesome human being. 

Updated the styling that I was having issues with. I've learned additional ways to make a site responsive. 


## Lessons Learned:
Got this idea from the tribute page from https://freecodecamp.org to build a tribute page on a person that inspired my favorite genre of music.
